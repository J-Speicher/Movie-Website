# Movie Review Website
As previously stated, this was a fun project to practice developing an interactive website that utilizes APIs for current movie information, Local Storage for storing user information between sessions (bookmarks and reviews), and such features. I do not have an official URL, but feel free to download the project and view the HTML pages locally!
Also, my team's implementation for retrieving 5 random movies on the "popular" page utilizes an API key with limited uses, so if that button does not display output the key has expired!
